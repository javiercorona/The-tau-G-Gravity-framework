🚀 Final LinkedIn Post: The \tau-G-Gravity Framework
🤯 Challenge Accepted: Is Gravity the Product of Mass, or the Geometry of Entanglement?
The \tau-G-Gravity framework introduces the Additive \tau-Gradient Law and proposes a revolutionary foundation for physics:
 * Additive Source: Gravity is an emergent geometric phenomenon linked to the sum of masses (m_1 + m_2), not the product (m_1 \times m_2). This defines mass as an additive contributor to a geometric temporal gradient, not a multiplicative force agent.
 * Unification by Connection: All forces—Gravity, Electromagnetism, etc.—are unified geometrically within a single Connection Field (\hat{X}), with a universal master equation governing their collective curvature.
 * Entanglement Creates Spacetime: Spacetime curvature is not fundamental but arises from the coarse-graining of microscopic quantum entanglement. We derive the Born Rule geometrically, showing that probability density equals local Entanglement Density (\rho_{\text{ent}}).
🔬 The Testable Challenge to the Universe
This theory moves beyond philosophy with concrete, high-stakes predictions derived from the Entanglement Stress-Energy Tensor (T_{\text{ENT}}).
The most critical test involves the Modified Dispersion Relation (MDR):
 * Prediction: Photon speed is energy-dependent, reduced in regions of high entanglement gradient \nabla \rho_{\text{ent}}.
   
 * Empirical Target: This predicts that high-energy photons from distant cosmic events will arrive later than low-energy photons. Analyzing the timing data from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)  offers the direct, quantum-gravity signature needed to validate or falsify this framework.
