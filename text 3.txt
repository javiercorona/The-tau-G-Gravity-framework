   · Gravity (Ω), gauge fields (A), and translations (Θ) emerge from single structure
2. F̂ = dX̂ + X̂ ∧ X̂
   · Total curvature from unified connection
   · All field strengths (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.) are manifestations of one geometric curvature
3. D̂ ⋆ F̂ = Ĵ
   · The one master equation governing everything
