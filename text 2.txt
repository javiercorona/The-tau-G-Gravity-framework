📝 Draft Abstract: The \tau-G-Gravity Framework (Geometric Unification and Entanglement-Generated Spacetime)
This paper presents the \tau-G-Gravity framework, a unified geometric theory predicated on two fundamental principles: Unification via a Connection Field and Spacetime Emergence from Entanglement.
1. Geometric Unification: All fundamental forces (gravity \Omega, gauge fields A, and translations \Theta) are unified within a single geometric entity, the Connection Field \hat{X} (\hat{X} = \Omega + A + \Theta). Field strengths are manifestations of a unified curvature \hat{F}, whose dynamics are governed by a single master geometric equation, \hat{D} \star \hat{F} = \hat{J}.
2. Entanglement is Geometry: Spacetime curvature is not fundamental but emergent from quantum information. Specifically, the classical Ricci scalar R(x) is shown to arise from the Laplacian of a coarse-grained Entanglement Density Field, \rho_{\text{ent}}(x). The theory establishes a Quantum-Gravity Bridge by proposing that the Born Rule emerges geometrically: the probability density |\psi(x)|^2 is equivalent to the entanglement density \rho_{\text{ent}}(x) in that region. Furthermore, the gravitational field is governed by a modified Einstein equation where the source term includes the Stress-Energy Tensor of Entanglement (T_{\text{ENT}}).
3. Testable Signatures and Geometric Dynamics: The introduction of the T_{\text{ENT}} term predicts specific deviations from both General Relativity and standard Quantum Mechanics. The framework introduces a \rho_{\text{ent}}-dependent modification to the dispersion relation (E^2 \approx p^2c^2 + m^2c^4 + \beta(\nabla\rho_{\text{ent}})^2), leading to two high-value empirical targets:
 * Energy-Dependent Photon Velocity (v_g \neq c): Photons are predicted to slow down in regions of rapid entanglement change.
 * GRB Timing Delay: High-energy photons from distant sources, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), should arrive later than their low-energy counterparts .
The \tau-G-Gravity framework offers a comprehensive, testable path towards geometric unification, challenging the established axiomatic foundations of both quantum mechanics and gravity. We invite open collaboration to validate the mathematical consistency and test the predicted empirical signatures.
