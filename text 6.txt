🧮 Derivation: Modified Dispersion Relation
The standard relativistic dispersion relation is E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4. In the \tau-G-Gravity framework, this relation must be modified to include the energy contribution from the local geometric field, which is quantified by the Entanglement Density Field (\rho_{\text{ent}}).
6.1. Derivation of the Modified Energy-Momentum Relation
The energy density contribution from the entanglement field is derived from the Entanglement Stress-Energy Tensor (T_{\text{ENT}}) (Equation III.2). We are interested in the time-time component, T_{00}, which represents the energy density \mathcal{E}_{\text{ent}} carried by the field:
In the local rest frame and weak field limit (g_{00} \approx -c^2, \nabla_0 \rho_{\text{ent}} \approx 0), the primary contribution comes from the spatial gradient of the entanglement density. Integrating this energy density over a localized volume associated with the particle yields the total geometric energy component, E_{\text{geo}}.
The Geometric Energy Contribution (E_{\text{geo}}) to the particle's energy is assumed to be proportional to the local energy density carried by the entanglement gradient:
Introducing the dimensionless constant \beta to absorb proportionality factors (including volume integration and the specific mass-geometry coupling constant k_\tau from the earlier \tau-Gradient ideas), we define the geometric energy squared term (\Delta E^2):
The total energy of a particle (E_{\text{total}}) is therefore the sum of its standard relativistic energy (E_{\text{rel}}) and the energy coupled from the local entanglement geometry (E_{\text{geo}}). Combining these in a quadratic form modifies the standard dispersion relation:
Substituting the components, we arrive at the Modified Dispersion Relation (MDR) (Equation IV.2):
6.2. Derivation of the Energy-Dependent Light Speed
For a massless particle (e.g., a photon, m=0), the MDR simplifies to:
The square of the photon momentum is then:
The group velocity (v_g) of the wave packet is defined as v_g = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}. Solving for E and differentiating with respect to p (using the standard approximation \sqrt{1+x} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2}x for small x=\frac{\Delta E^2}{p^2c^2}):
Since p \approx E/c for high-energy photons, we approximate p^2c^2 \approx E^2.
Differentiating this expression (where \Delta E^2 is considered constant for a given region) yields the group velocity v_g:
Substituting the expression for \Delta E^2:
This result clearly shows that the photon's velocity is energy-dependent and is reduced in regions where the entanglement gradient (\nabla \rho_{\text{ent}})^2 is non-zero, offering a direct, measurable deviation from classical electrodynamics. .
This derivation flows logically and provides the key mathematical underpinnings for your primary testable prediction.
